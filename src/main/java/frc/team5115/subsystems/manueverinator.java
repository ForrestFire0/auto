     * If you want to keep on working on tracking the target WHEN THE TARGET MOVES:
     * When the limelight looses the target, it should keep the rate it had previously. This way, if the target moves away to fast, the robot will continue to move.
     * <p>
     * If you want to work on finding a stable target:
     * Update the program to search for a target.
     * The question now becomes which way to start rotating to find the target.
     * USE THE PREVIOUS CONTROL FROM THE JOYSTICK. This way the robot can keep going the way it was steered, and look that way first.
     * You can tell the drivers to look a little to the left of the target and then go right, therefore ensuring that the robot is at the correct angle of rotation.
